What should the game look like?


SUPER MINIMAL PROTOTYPE:

* Adventurers spawn at layer 0.  You can control the rate with some very very rudimentary UI.
* (DONE!) Below are n layers of randomly generated rooms.  Let's say they are all square rooms with up, down, left, or right exits.
* (DONE!) The random generation will guarantee there is a path accessible to the next layer.
* You can scroll up and down from the top to the bottom.
* Monsters will spawn randomly in the rooms (let's say, dragons and goblins).  You can control the rate with some very very rudimentary UI.
* Monsters will not move on their own yet, or move very simply.
* Adventurers will, on their own, wander around the dungeon.
* When an adventurer meets a monster, they will stop and fight.  Basically, if they collide, they will freeze, and "battle".
* battles are like this:  every second, they alternate making attacks against each other.
* Each monster/adventurer has a health bar visible.  When the health bar goes to zero, that monster/adventurer dies.

"COMPLETE" (VAGUE) VERSION:

* You are the guild master  Your goal is to clear the dungeon for some reason tbd.  But you are weak or whatever.
* Guild management simulation / idle game.  Keyword:  ANT FARM
* Your management decisions indirectly may affect:
  * Adventurer spawn rate
  * Types of adventurers (clerics, mages, fighters, etc.)
  * How strong they are, their gear, party sizes, etc.
  * Their level-up and job change/upgrade progressions
  * The guild's income
  * Monster spawn rates, patterns, etc.
  * Dungeon events, room shuffling, randomness, etc.
* Adventurers either take quests from the guild or free roam in the dungeon.
* There might be some management of shops as well, mostly indirectly.  TBD how actively the guild has a presence in the stores and town.
* You can set infrastructure to be built in the dungeon, some ideas:
  * reinforcements to prevent certain rooms from getting shuffled during earthquakes
  * tunnels and ladders and doors between rooms that don't have a connection currently
  * safe rooms for adventurers to rest in
  * teleporters between two rooms
  * farms and gardens and mines
  * traps and defensive structures
  * lures for certain kinds of monsters (either to keep them away or to attract more of them)
  * mini outposts where adventurers can report or take quests deeper in the dungeon.
* Monsters will spawn in various ways.  idk how this will work yet.  Probably they will wander in from off the map or in dedicated spawn areas.
* Some sort of quest management system.  example, you post them yourself and take a cut of e.g. the spoils, or you list 3rd party quests and take a cut of the reward.
